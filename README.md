# the cat in the hat

Speech recognition experiment. Works on Chrome for desktop and Android. Probably doesn't work anywhere else. Isn't polished. The CSS will look crazy if you're not on a mobile phone (unless you resize your desktop window so that it resembles a mobile phone).

## running the demo

Clone or download this repo, navigate into the folder, then run `http-server` (or equivalent). Hit 'start reading' and, well, start reading. In theory, your browser will listen to when you've finished reading the page and turn it for you.
